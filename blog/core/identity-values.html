      <h3>
        My five core identity pillars
      </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Faith</li>
        <p>I am a Christian.I believe in Jesus Christ as my King, rock and savior. And my hope is to be a better human
          being every day.</p>
        <li>Wellbeing</li>
        <p>I want to die sober. I walk in recovery from alcohol and drugs abuse disorder. I will amount to nothing if I
          don't stay sober. I recover outloud to tell others who are struggling in silence that they are not alone. I
          also need to maintain my health and energy for my family and my own life journey. I completed the Berlin
          Marathon 42.2km in 2019.</p>
        <li>Family</li>
        <p>I am a proud dad and I love my family.I pray that I get the opportunity to raise them well. They are my
          anchor in this life.</p>
        <li>Entrepreneurship</li>
        <p>I am an entrepreneur.I use my work for impact. I want to help create a world where we are kinder to one
          another.I believe in the power of entrepreneurship to create vehicles of positive influence.</p>
        <li>Growth</li>
        <p>I am a lifelong student who is always growing. I am an active member of the TED community and a board member
          at
          Entrepreneurs' Organisation NZ chapter. And now I am learning how to code at Dev Academy.</p>
      </ol>

      <p>Every year, I assess, review, rethink, realign, and set goals for myself based on these five core identity
        pillars.
      </p>


      <h3>
        Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.
      </h3>
      <p>In my work, I deal with many government contracts in Indonesia. A couple of years ago, we were the leading
        contender for a project until a very powerful government official approached us to request bribe money for us to
        secure the project. This person’s request was unreasonable and unethical. I don’t believe in discounting our own
        value and capabilities in winning the projects. I said no.
      </p>
      <p>As a consequence, our chances diminished significantly. We came under constant attack and this official pushed
        for our competitor. I remember telling my team that we’re going to “science the shit out of this”. We decided we
        were going to double down on proving our technical and project capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>In the final stages of the project, our proposal and detailed technical presentation were superior by a huge
        margin that the decision makers were convinced we were the only one in the country who could take on and deliver
        the project. This was a lesson for my team about the importance of building real and provable intrinsic
        capabilities and values in our company.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.
      </h3>
      <p>I am a third culture kid. That means I spent my formative years split between Indonesia, Singapore, New
        Zealand, the US, and Australia. It wasn’t easy being away from home and my parents since young. But that shaped
        me in both the good and the bad.</p>
      <p>Growing up as a minority in all these countries gave me an undying fighting spirit. I know how to survive and
        hustle. I think it’s beautiful that growing up this way has led me to be innately incapable of differentiating
        people based on color, race, religion, or beliefs; rather for their character, values, vision, spirit, impact. I
        have been so blessed to have so many friends from all corners of the world through my upbringing and travels.
      </p>
      <p>Of course, it was hard being on the road on my own. I had insufficient parental guidance and had to rely on
        street-smarts to adapt and assimilate. That led me to many wrong paths that I wasn’t smart enough not to take.
        Past trauma, unresolved pain, and pathological loneliness shaped a big part of me until recent years. It was
        only after I got sober that I could start healing.</p>
      <p>Being of Chinese-Indonesian heritage also has its good and bad impacts. Positively, the business-oriented
        upbringing of a Chinese-Indonesian, has led me to understand entrepreneurship more intuitively. However, my
        culture has a lot of intergenerational pains being passed down. These came from our people’s need to survive in
        foreign countries. I am trying to break that chain of pain when it comes to my own children.</p>
      <p>Lastly and more importantly, for me, in my journey, at the end of the day, all roads lead back to my faith in
        Jesus Christ.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning
        obstacles.
      </h3>
      <p>The MBTI test would classify me as an ENTJ. Although, I don’t believe you can classify people into 16 boxes.
        It’s close enough.</p>
      <p>In all the personality tests I have ever taken, I am clearly a very extroverted person who gets a lot of energy
        from the presence of others. I have a very high degree of openness to experiences and learning. I love ideas.
      </p>
      <p>Gallup Top Strengths</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Achiever</li>
        <p>I work hard and possess a great deal of stamina.</p>
        <li>Strategic</li>
        <p>I create alternative ways to proceed, spot the relevant patterns and issues.</p>
        <li>Learner</li>
        <p>I have a great desire to learn and want to continuously improve.</p>
        <li>Command</li>
        <p>I can take control of a situation and make decisions.</p>
        <li>Futuristic</li>
        <p>I energize others with my visions of the future</p>
      </ol>
      <p>I believe all the strengths above will help me in my learning journey at Dev Academy. I am consistently known
        as a “door-breaker” - for my ability to persist and push through challenges until we arrive at a solution. I am
        a people person who naturally gravitates toward a position of leadership in any community or tribe I am involved
        with. I help and coach others to be better versions of themselves. In the process of doing so, learning more
        about myself and how I can continue to grow.
      </p>
      <p>I anticipate a lot of challenges that will push us to break our limits of logical thinking and endurance. I
        will use these strengths to endure and to encourage others to do the same. I look forward to more peer-to-peer
        learning as the program unfolds.</p>


      <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
      <p>I will ask for help. I know I will need help.</p>

      <h3>An example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was
        resistance or tension.</h3>
      <p>Two of my teams at different companies had a recent conflict. They were blaming one another silently. And that
        led to back and forth communication and paperwork that weren’t getting things done. As a result, we were in
        danger of not delivering the products to the client. </p>
      <p>Solutions were drawn, progress was made and now we are back on track in delivering on the outcome. The strategy
        and action were on point for this situation. But looking back, this situation will not happen if we had spent
        enough time in the past clarifying our expectations and process better. Work is ongoing to improve on this
        front.</p>
