        <h2>Learning Plan</h2>
        <small>2 July 2022</small>
      </header>

      <h3>
        What is your long term goal or career pathway?
      </h3>

      <p>I started my career in Finance with Bloomberg LP until I left the company in 2008 to complete my postgraduate
        study (MBA). Since then, I have been an entrepreneur for the last 13 years. For now, this remains to be my
        career path - to build ventures. However, I have to admit, the emotional roller coaster of entrepreneurship has
        started to take a toll on me.
      </p>

      <p>
        That said, right now, I am going to learn how to be a developer first. This is the right thing to do (for me)
        before I attempt any new venture in technology. However, due to my skills and experience in business, it is
        likely my long-term path will remain in the business or commercial side of things; or at least a hybrid role
        like a management position in a technology company.
      </p>

      <h3>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.
      </h3>
      <p>My number 1 strength in learning is my beginner’s mindset. I don’t mind to be “dumb” and I have learnt to say I
        don’t know. This gives me open mindedness and genuine curiosity. I am also a strong pattern recognizer and
        strategizer. I am able to see the big picture, ask critical questions, and carry intellectual conversations on
        different topics of interest. I can be in “flow” for a long-time if I am really interested in something. I am
        also an audio-visual learner who learns best from talks, presentations and peer-to-peer learning.</p>
      <p>My number 1 weakness in learning is impatience and taking shortcuts when it comes to the details. Sometimes
        with a small knowledge of something, I would jump into conclusions without really going to the heart of the
        matter. My reliance toward data is inconsistent and often my interpretation would be biased in favor of my
        existing world view. My big-picture thinking can sometimes prevent me from thinking logically or in systematic
        order.</p>
      <p>For a long time, I have also struggled with mental health and thus depressive episodes can translate into
        procrastination. I need deadlines and accountability. Lastly, I don’t have the patience for lengthy reading
        materials. </p>

      <h3>
        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h3>
      <p>I would like to be better at discipline and time management. I lost my productive rhythm during Covid times and
        I have been struggling to get it back.</p>
      <p>I also want to develop more endurance and persistence. I have a stake in a coding bootcamp in Indonesia so I
        know these programs are designed to push us to break our own limits. I am anticipating some rough times ahead,
        but I want to see this through. </p>
      <p>Lastly, in my last tech startup (that folded under Covid economic pressure), my development team consistently
        argued that I didn’t understand the “development culture”, the stress, and time it takes to do things. I want to
        understand this culture.</p>

      <h3>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
      </h3>
      <p>I have informed my work team members and my family members of my time commitment to this program. I have also
        blocked out August and September from any overseas travel or conference commitments. I am going to be there
        on-campus doing this program (with the exception of the two days that I mentioned earlier to Jared).
        I have genuine trust and respect for others, but I also know how to protect my barriers when needed. I expect to
        be on the ‘older-end’ of my cohort. My partying days are over. I am here to work and to really learn how to
        become a developer.</p>
      <p>I am sure things will build up and will get to me at some point. My plan is to be authentic and real; to say
        things as they are. I will reach out for help and I will cry in front of you if I need to. I have learnt to be
        better with vulnerability.</p>
      <p>Even at this stage of the program, I can feel this internal voice of “oh shit these guys are better than me”. I
        am acknowledging and accepting these feelings. However, I also understand that I will not make progress if I am
        stuck with not asking for help.
      </p>

      <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
      <p>I will ask for help. I know I will need help.</p>

      <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.</h3>
      <p>I am coming into the program as an “older” student. I am nervous at being slow and overwhelmed by the contents
        in the coming days. If I don’t get it, please be patient with me. I am committed to getting it. From time to
        time, I may need some hand holding.</p>
      <p>I expect my facilitators to tell me as it is. Tell me if I am slacking and procrastinating; and encourage me to
        pick up the pace. I expect (and will need help) to be accountable for the deadlines; especially if I miss a few
        already. Please let me know if my own worldviews and past experience as an entrepreneur get in the way of my
        learning or if I am being arrogant.</p>
      <p>Please be aware that I am someone who lives in recovery. This means I have a chronic struggle with mental
        health and my energy levels (and mood) will reflect these bouts. Ask me how I am doing if you see me having the
        blues.</p>

      <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h3>
      <p>I take my kids from 730am to 8:05am. I am planning to get a second car so I can travel to town else I’ll take
        the train or uber; I should be able to make it by 845am.</p>
      <p>Wednesday Aug 24th, Sep 28th at 7:30am - 9am and 2pm - 6pm; I have commitments for Entrepreneurs’ Organization.
        It will be hard for me to bail out from these commitments.</p>
      <p>From time to time, I may need to take 10-15 minutes calls if there’s something urgent at my work that requires
        immediate attention. For the most part, I have tried to make sure I have no operations commitments during the
        bootcamp.</p>
