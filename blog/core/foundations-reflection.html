      <h3>
        What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?
      </h3>

      <p>I learned that optimal thinking cannot take place when the brain is under emotional stress. Sometimes, the
        solution is simply to just step back and take a walk or a breather.
      </p>

      <p>
        I learned that it was tougher than I thought to ask for help. I didn't want to be that person who didn't rise up
        to the challenge. So I waited and avoided working on the problem. It was only after I humbled myself that I
        could progress.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, I also learned that I have a lot to offer myself, my family, and my fellow classmates. In my post on
        Identity & Values, I shared a list of testimonials that others gave me in the past. That exercise reminded me
        that there are many who would testify to my experience and capabilities.
      </p>

      <h3>
        What is the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
      </h3>
      <p>
        For me, it was important to question my values and my vision to understand my real motivation or "why" for doing
        this. Despite being a beginner in this journey, I discovered that I indeed love technology and would love to
        learn more.
      </p>
      <p>This is a tough undertaking. I can see how empathy will be important in our journey toward becoming a
        developer. I will need empathy from my facilitators and my cohort mates when I stumble and face challenges.
        Empathy will also be essential when we are working in teams.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have to continue to be self-aware about my own mental state and motivation. When I am stressed, I must take a
        break, re-approach the problem, and ask for help. I must also find the motivation to persist.
      </p>

      <h3>
        What has surprised you the most about core learning?
      </h3>
      <p>
        As someone who is an experienced entrepreneur, business leader, and people person, I thought I had mastered all
        the topics in the core learning. At first, I was doing it because I had to do it as part of the program. But
        luckily, I kept a "shoshin" or "beginner's" mindset. I learned new things. I reflected on my own emotional
        intelligence and areas in it that I need to improve such as self-awareness and self-regulation. I learned more
        about neuroplasticity and was encouraged by how I can still 'grow my brain' through learning.

      <h3>
        What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
      </h3>
      <p>Taking the time to really reflect and to be honest in my thinking. In the past, I have done a lot of this
        "core" work, and I was reluctant to do it all over again. As shared earlier, luckily, I had a beginner's mindset
        and did the work as instructed. </p>

      <p>It was also tough to be vulnerable to strangers - having to reach out for listening and looping, having to put
        down these thoughts for a public blog, and having to ask questions in the forum when I got stuck. </p>


      <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web
        development Bootcamp course?</h3>

      <p>Because at the end of the day, we're humans. We need to overcome our own emotional brains and we need to work
        with other people. The program will be tough. It is good to equip the students with mindsets that will see them
        through the journey; especially if things are going to progressively get tougher. Also, this boot camp is
        preparing its students for the real world where programmers have to work with others and in a team setting.
        Human and core skills are an important part of employability. </p>

      <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that
        time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>

      <p>No, it hasn't. Although I was "lazy" to do the work in the beginning, I have grown to enjoy the Core Part of
        the program as I get to discover more things about myself through reflections and writing. I shared about these
        core learnings with my friend who not long ago completed a development Bootcamp at a different school. He felt
        that was missing at his old school.
