      <p>
        In recovery groups, we often remind ourselves that only an insane person would try a strategy that doesn't work
        over and over again while expecting a different result. For us addicts, drinking our problems away didn't work
        and we needed an alternative way to face our challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same can be said for problem solving in general. Sometimes, in the face of a wicked problem, maybe we need
        to take a few steps back and reflect on the problem to find a more effective approach or solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, I found that clarity is often not straight forward. My own biases would at times prevent me from
        having clarity and objectivity about the true nature of the issue at hand. I have gotten better in taking the
        time to ask better questions to define the things I need to solve.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Simple problems
      </h3>
      <p>
        I grew up with a lot of reminders of scarcity in life. Consequently, I have always been big on cost
        optimisation. That means, I don't like to over spend or pay more than I should for something. However, this
        became a problem when my bargain hunting led me to spending too much precious time in solving small, simple
        problems such as booking accommodation online.
      </p>
      <p>
        I decided to get better. I took the time to define the requirements and budgets I would have for different
        scenarios. I researched online about the strategies other people use and develop better mental models for this
        simple task. I also enrolled into loyalty programs such as Bonvoy or Booking.com. I briefed and coached my
        personal assistant on these thoughts and outsourced the task for her to manage.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are faced with thousands of decisions everyday. We make these decisions mostly unconsciously. I found the
        exercise of fine-tuning my better mental models has helped me in automating these decision-making tasks and
        ensuring good outcomes.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Big problems
      </h3>
      <p>
        In my earlier blog post, I shared about a time when a corrupt government official was ruining our chances to get
        a sales deal we were working at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I remember feeling discouraged. At that moment, I turned to my favorite problem solving tools in life:
        mind-mapping with the white board and post-its. I mind-mapped the problem, the deal, the stakeholders, the
        issues,
        and questions. I printed photos of people who were involved and found connections and insights that weren't
        obvious to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a team effort and we fine-tuned our approach to the deal, improved our technical proposal and connected
        with other influential decision makers who could help our cause.We won the deal and I used this case as an
        example to my team on the power of mind-mapping.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Problem-solving techniques/processes:
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Pseudocode</li>
        <p>
          I am a big fan of pseudocode not only in coding but also in life. Getting clarity on the problem and
          simplifying the steps or milestones I need to see in plain words are invaluable. I must admit in the past, I
          wouldn't have
          the patience to do it diligently. I want to improve and pseudocode the solutions of most complex problems that
          I have in life - in and outside of programming.</p>
        <li>Trying something</li>

        <p>
          I have never had a problem in trying something new. However, I learn that "trying something" can be smarter
          if the problems, goals, and ideal solutions are more articulated. When I take the time to articulate and
          clearly
          define what I am trying to accomplish - I would be able to try solutions that are more align to my objectives.
        </p>

        <li>Rubber ducky method</li>
        <p>
          Even without the duck, you would find me talking to myself when I am trying to solve a problem. So this method
          of discussing with an imaginary duck comes very naturally to me.
        </p>
        <li>Reading error messages and Console.logging</li>
        <p>
          I wasn't used to this method at first. However, getting stuck in the various problems and tasks during the
          foundation sprints has left me with no choice to look for error messages and console.logging. I love it now
          because these methods help me narrow my attention to where the problem is.
        </p>
        <li>Googling</li>
        <p>
          Confident with this as I google everything. It is important for me, however, to understand which resources are
          relevant and of good quality.
        </p>

        <li>
          Asking your peers for help and asking coaches for help
        </li>
        <p>
          For the foundation sprints, I have tried to find the solutions myself first and exhaust my options before
          asking for help. Most of the time, I would be able to find the answer either online or on another
          communication thread already posted on Discord. That said, I have no issue in asking for help from my peers or
          coaches.
        </p>

        <li>
          Improving your process with reflection
        </li>
        <p>
          Writing reflections and articulating my journey have helped me tremendously. I read it somewhere that "good
          thinking is precise". And reflecting and writing down my thoughts help fine-tune the precision of my thinking.
