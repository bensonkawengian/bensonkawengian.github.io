        <h2>JS Fundamentals</h2>
        <small>9 July 2022</small>
      </header>

      <h3>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</h3>
      <p>In my last blog, I shared that there are three cornerstones technologies of the World Wide Web: HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript. If a web page is like a Hallmark greeting card, then HTML is the text that says "Happy Birthday!",
        the CSS defines the style, font, and color, and lastly JavaScript is the ability to open the card and hear the
        music inside. Remember one of those musical cards? Gawd, I feel old.</p>

      <p>JavaScript is a dominant force in the programming world. Created just over 26 years ago, one estimate suggests
        that it's used as a client-side programming language by around 98% of all websites in the world. "Client-side
        programming" is just a fancy way of saying that it is intended for you to see as the viewers of the web, runs on
        the client machine or browser, and deals with the user interface.</p>

      <p>In another analogy, you can think of it as a 'muscle' that moves your skeleton, and bones, and activates your
        vocal chord so you can express movement and share your thoughts or 'content with the world. In these muscles,
        you can also store some behavioral memories or logic, such as "when you touch the stove and it's hot, let go and
        pull your hand immediately"</p>

      <h3>
        Control Flow and Loops
      </h3>
      <p>In programming, there is the term "control flow". It means the sequence or order in which coded instructions
        are being executed. Imagine if you are trying to follow your grandma's family pasta recipe and she told you to
        follow the recipe diligently from step 1 to step 10 without taking shortcuts. You wouldn't want to upset her by
        taking shortcuts, would you? Grandma already specified her "control flow" for you to follow and every single
        time you attempt the family recipe, you better execute as instructed.</p>

      <p>Control flows are an integral part of most programming languages as they allow your code to take actions based
        on various situations or conditions. The JavaScript programming language relies heavily on the control flow
        structures as well.</p>

      <p>There are simpler control flows such as "read the file and execute from top to bottom", but there are others
        that allow you to accomplish different objectives, such as loops. A loop is a set of instructions that are
        repeated until a defined condition is met.</p>
      <p>Let's go back to our grandma's recipe example.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Step 5 requires you to add salt one teaspoon at a time up to 5 teaspoons</li>
        <li>Step 6 requires you to taste the pasta sauce, and only if the sauce is not salty enough, add another 1
          teaspoon
          of salt. Repeat this until you find the saltiness satisfactory.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Both of these steps are different types of repetitions (or loops). You will "execute" step 5 first without
        tasting or regardless of its saltiness. Then, and only then, you move on to step 6. And you stop when you are
        satisfied with the saltiness level (i.e. the condition is met).</p>
      <h3>In Java Script, these are the five different types of loops:
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>for - loops through a block of code a number of times</li>
        <li>for/in - loops through the properties of an object</li>
        <li>for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object</li>
        <li>while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true</li>
        <li>do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Let's look at some examples for loops
      </h3>


      <pre>
        <code>
          for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
            // code block to be executed
          }
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>Example in practice:</p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          &lt;script&gt;
            let text = "";
            
            for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
              text += "The number is " + i + &lt;"br&gt;";
            }
            
            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = text;
          &lt;/script&gt;
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>From the example above, you can read:
        Statement 1 sets a variable before the loop starts (let i = 0).Statement 2 defines the condition for the loop to
        run (i must be less than 5). Statement 3 increases a value (i++) each time the code block in the loop has been
        executed.The output is as follows:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          The number is 0
          The number is 1
          The number is 2
          The number is 3
          The number is 4
      </code>
      </pre>

      <h3>DOM and an example of how you might interact with it
      </h3>

      <p>Let's move on to the next concept DOM, not Dominic or DOM from Fast and Furious, but Document Object Model
        (DOM). It took me a while to get it because my head cannot escape referring to <a target="_blank"
          href=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004874>Vin Diesel</a> when the term DOM was
        triggered. But I think I have figured it out.</p>

      <p>Let's go back to Grandma. Imagine Grandma belongs to a community of 100 passionate pasta makers fully adamant
        about gifting the world the next life-changing pasta. However, they are open-minded about the process and are
        willing to exchange notes about how to fine-tune their pasta sauce recipe.</p>

      <p>Since there are so many of them, each coming to the gathering with their own unique and special recipe, the
        community decided they needed some ground rules. They decided that going onward every single recipe must be
        written with specified categories that are in order:</p>

      <pre>
          <code>
            [1] The Setup 
             .. Shopping List
             .. Equipment List 
            [2] The Cooking
             .. Preparing
             .. Cooking 
                .. Stove
                .. Tasting
             .. Presenting
            [3] The Clean Up
          </code>
        </pre>

      <p>This method allows changing and finetuning each pasta maker's recipe, even sharing with others without
        confusing the whole knowledge body of life-changing pasta. And thus, programmers and the people at World Wide
        Web Consortium decided to learn from these grandmas in the 90s and issued the DOM.</p>

      <p>In web development, the DOM or Document Object Model is a cross-platform application programming interface
        (API)
        that treats an HTML or XML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of
        the document. The DOM represents a document with a logical tree.</p>

      This way, the "objects" within these documents can be "targeted" by instructions (internal or external) so they
      can be modified or can respond in certain ways.</p>

      <h3>
        DOM: Document Object Model
      </h3>

      <p>The HTML DOM Tree of Objects
      </p>
      <img src="../../assets/images/technical/DOM-2.png" alt="document object model"><br>

      <p>With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>change all the HTML elements in the page</li>
        <li>change all the HTML attributes in the page</li>
        <li>change all the CSS styles in the page</li>
        <li>remove existing HTML elements and attributes</li>
        <li>add new HTML elements and attributes</li>
        <li>react to all existing HTML events in the page</li>
        <li>create new HTML events in the page</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>The following example changes the content (the innerHTML) of the p element with id="demo":</p>

      <pre>
          <code>
            &lt;html&gt;
            &lt;body&gt;

            &lt;p id="demo"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;script &gt;
                document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello World!";
            &lt;/script &gt;

            &lt;/body &gt;
            &lt;/html &gt;

          </code>
        </pre>
      <h3>
        The difference between accessing data from arrays and objects
      </h3>

      <p>Both arrays and objects are special data storage types in JavaScript. They are both mutable (changeable) and
        can consist of multiple data points (collection of data or a list of values instead of a single value).</p>

      <p>If the data you are working on are entities with multiple characteristics or properties, you want an object. If
        the data are entities where characteristics are the same or similar, or if you need them in a distinct order,
        you are likely to need an array instead.</p>

      <h3>Objects</h3>
      <p>Objects are used to represent a “thing” in your code. That could be a person, a car, a building, a book, a
        character in a game — basically anything that is made up or can be defined by a set of characteristics.</p>

      <p>Example of an Object
      </p>
      <img src="../../assets/images/technical/object-example.png" alt="objects example"><br>

      <p>You can create the above object this way:</p>
      <blockquote>let car = {name:"Fiat", model:"500", weight:"850kg", color:"white"};</blockquote>
      <pre>
        <code>
          // Example 'person' object

            var person = {
                    name: 'Cody',
                    age: 88,
                    likesCoding: true
                          };
            var person2 = {
                    name: 'James',
                    age: 21,
                    likesCoding: true
                          };
        </code>
      </pre>

      <p>You can access object properties in two ways:</p>
      <pre>
      <code>
        objectName.propertyName
        
            or

        objectName["propertyName"]
      </code>
      </pre>

      <h3>Arrays</h3>
      <p>We use arrays whenever we want to create and store a list of multiple items in a single variable. Arrays are
        especially useful when creating ordered collections where items in the collection can be accessed by their
        numerical position in the list.</p>
      <p>Using an array literal is the easiest way to create a JavaScript Array.Syntax:</p>
      <p>const array_name = [item1, item2, ...]; </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
            var vacationSpots = ['Tokyo', 'Bali', 'Mexico City', 'Vancouver'];
            const colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue'];
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>Another example of array being used in combination with loops and DOM</p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          &lt;script&gt;
          var arr1 = [50,60,65,90];
          var arr2 = [25,35,50,90];
          
          for (i = 0; i &lt; arr1.length; i++) {
              for (z = 0; z &lt; arr1.length; z++) 
                {if (arr1[i] === arr2[z]) {
                     document.write("&lt;br&gt;Matched element: "+arr2[z]);}}}
          &lt;/script&gt;
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>You access an array element by referring to the index number.Note: Array indexes start with 0.
        [0] is the first element. [1] is the second element.</p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
          let car = cars[0];
        </code>
      </pre>


      <h3>JavaScript Functions</h3>
      <p>JavaScript functions are blocks of codes designed to perform actions, execute instructions, and store a set of
        logic that can be "invoked" or "called" in another part of the document. We can call a JavaScript function many
        times to reuse the code allowing us to build complex algorithms, make our programs to amazing actions, save time
        coding, and make our program more compact because we don't have to rewrite many lines of code each time to
        perform a common task</p>

      <p><i>Two main steps to a function: declare a function and invoke a function.</i></p>

      <p>A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().</p>

      <p>Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).
        The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:(parameter1, parameter2, ...). The code to be
        executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}</p>
      <pre>
          <code>
            function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
                // code to be executed
              }              
          </code>
        </pre>

      <p>The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)</li>
        <li>When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code</li>
        <li>Automatically (self invoked)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For example, the following add() function returns the sum of the two arguments:</p>
      <pre>
          <code>
            function add(a, b) {
              return a + b;
              }        
          </code>
      </pre>
      <p>The following shows how to call the add() function:</p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          let sum = add(10, 20);
          console.log('Sum:', sum);      
        </code>
    </pre>
      <p>Here's the output on the console:</p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          Sum: 30      
        </code>
    </pre>
